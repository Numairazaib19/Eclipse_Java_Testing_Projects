**Introduction**
BellyFeature is a feature designed to test the belly growling behavior after eating cucumbers ("cukes"). This README file provides an overview of the feature and the test scenarios associated with it.

**Feature Description**
The BellyFeature is intended to validate the expected growling behavior of a person's belly under different conditions of cucumber consumption and waiting periods. The scenarios outlined below serve as test cases to verify the correctness of this functionality.

**Scenarios**
The BellyFeature consists of three scenarios, each representing a specific test case:

1. **Scenario: eaten many cukes and wait 2 and growl**
   - Given: The test setup assumes that the person has eaten 42 cukes.
   - When: The person waits for 2 hours.
   - Then: The expected outcome is that their belly should growl.

2. **Scenario: eaten few cukes and not growl**
   - Given: The test setup assumes that the person has eaten 3 cukes.
   - When: The person waits for 2 hours.
   - Then: The expected outcome is that their belly should not growl.

3. **Scenario: eaten many cukes and not growl**
   - Given: The test setup assumes that the person has eaten 20 cukes.
   - When: The person waits for 1 hour.
   - Then: The expected outcome is that their belly should not growl.

**Note**: For the tests to pass successfully, the belly growling behavior must adhere to the expected outcomes described in each scenario.
